CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /home/wwl/ros2-pinocchio/build/pinocchio_ros2_example/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/wwl/ros2_ws/build/pinocchio_ros2_example where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "/home/wwl/ros2-pinocchio/src/pinocchio_ros2_example/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/home/wwl/ros2_ws/src/pinocchio_ros2_example/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
